This is a walkthrough for creating a CA, Certificate Authority, and an SSL key and certificate. The reason for creating the CA is to inform client machines and browsers that your SSL certificates are legitimate.

The CA certificate, MyCompanyCA.cer, needs to be installed on any device that you wish to have recognize your SSL certificates as legitimate.

For security reasons, it is good practice to save the CA key, in this case MyCompanyCA.pvk, to a removable device, delete the copy from the computer and air gap the removable device from the system.

The reason for this is that if someone had access to the CA key, they could use it to sign certificates for malicious sites to trick your browser into assuming they are safe.

The removable device containing the CA key only needs to be connected when the CA key is needed for signing a new SSL certificate.

Note: replace all instances of MyCompanyCA and MyCompanyLocalhost with your desired names.

1. Create configuration file for your CA named MyCompanyCA.cnf with contents (you can change it to your needs):

[ req ]
distinguished_name  = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions     = root_ca

[ req_distinguished_name ]
countryName             = Country Name (2 letter code)
countryName_min         = 2
countryName_max         = 2
stateOrProvinceName     = State or Province Name (full name)
localityName            = Locality Name (eg, city)
0.organizationName      = Organization Name (eg, company)
organizationalUnitName  = Organizational Unit Name (eg, section)
commonName              = Common Name (eg, fully qualified host name)
commonName_max          = 64
emailAddress            = Email Address
emailAddress_max        = 64

[ root_ca ]
basicConstraints            = critical, CA:true


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Create the extensions configuration file MyCompanyLocalhost.ext for your web server certificate:

subjectAltName = @alt_names
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth

[alt_names]
DNS.1   = localhost
DNS.2   = mypc.mycompany.com
Then execute the following commands:
#IP address, optional, uncomment to use.
#IP.1 = 192.168.2.221
#IP.2 = 127.0.0.1


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Then execute the following commands:


openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -out MyCompanyCA.cer -outform PEM -keyout MyCompanyCA.pvk -days 10000 -verbose -config MyCompanyCA.cnf -nodes -sha256 -subj "/CN=MyCompany CA"

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout MyCompanyLocalhost.pvk -out MyCompanyLocalhost.req -subj /CN=localhost -sha256 -nodes

openssl x509 -req -CA MyCompanyCA.cer -CAkey MyCompanyCA.pvk -in MyCompanyLocalhost.req -out MyCompanyLocalhost.cer -days 10000 -extfile MyCompanyLocalhost.ext -sha256 -set_serial 0x1111

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. As result you will get MyCompanyCA.cer, MyCompanyLocalhost.cer and MyCompanyLocalhost.pvk files that you can install to the web server.

5. How to check that it works with Chrome before installing certificates to the web server. Execute the following command on your local PC to run web server simulator:

openssl s_server -accept 15000 -cert MyCompanyLocalhost.cer -key MyCompanyLocalhost.pvk -CAfile MyCompanyCA.cer -WWW


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Then you can access this page at https://localhost:15000/ You will see an error that MyCompanyLocalhost.cer is not trusted, if you want to eliminate this error also - then install MyCompanyCA.cer to the certificate trusted list of your OS.
